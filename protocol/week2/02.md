## Understanding Soft and Hard Links in Linux

In Linux, a link is a reference to a file or directory. It allows you to access a file or directory using a different name or path. There are two types of links in Linux: soft links (also known as symbolic links) and hard links.

### 1. Soft Links

Soft links: A soft link is a pointer to a file or directory that is stored as a separate file. It acts as a shortcut to the original file or directory. When you create a soft link, it creates a new file that points to the original file or directory. The soft link file contains the path to the original file or directory.

### Example of creating a soft link:

Suppose you have a file called "file.txt" located in the "/home/user/documents/" directory, and you want to create a soft link for it in the "/home/user/desktop/" directory. You can use the following command:

``` bash
ln -s /home/user/documents/file.txt /home/user/desktop/file_link
```

This creates a new file called "file_link" in the "/home/user/desktop/" directory, which points to the original file "file.txt" located in the "/home/user/documents/" directory. If you open the "file_link" file, it will open the original file "file.txt".

### 2. Hard Links

Hard links: A hard link is a reference to a file or directory that is stored as an additional directory entry. Unlike a soft link, a hard link does not create a new file. It creates another entry point to the original file or directory. Both the original file and the hard link point to the same physical data on the disk.

### Example of creating a hard link:

Suppose you have a file called "file.txt" located in the "/home/user/documents/" directory, and you want to create a hard link for it in the "/home/user/desktop/" directory. You can use the following command:

```bash
ln /home/user/documents/file.txt /home/user/desktop/file_link
```

This creates a hard link called "file_link" in the "/home/user/desktop/" directory, which points to the original file "file.txt" located in the "/home/user/documents/" directory. If you modify either the original file or the hard link, the changes will be reflected in both the files, as they both point to the same physical data on the disk.

> Note: You cannot create a hard link for a directory.

***In summary, a soft link creates a new file that points to the original file or directory, while a hard link creates another entry point to the original file or directory. Both soft and hard links allow you to access a file or directory using a different name or path, but they differ in how they are stored and how they behave when the original file is modified or deleted.***
