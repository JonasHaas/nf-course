## Understanding Soft and Hard Links in Linux

In Linux, a link is a reference to a file or directory. It allows you to access a file or directory using a different name or path. There are two types of links in Linux: soft links (also known as symbolic links) and hard links.

### 1. Soft Links

Soft links: A soft link is a pointer to a file or directory that is stored as a separate file. It acts as a shortcut to the original file or directory. When you create a soft link, it creates a new file that points to the original file or directory. The soft link file contains the path to the original file or directory.

### Example of creating a soft link:

Suppose you have a file called "file.txt" located in the "/home/user/documents/" directory, and you want to create a soft link for it in the "/home/user/desktop/" directory. You can use the following command:

``` bash
ln -s /home/user/documents/file.txt /home/user/desktop/file_link
```

This creates a new file called "file_link" in the "/home/user/desktop/" directory, which points to the original file "file.txt" located in the "/home/user/documents/" directory. If you open the "file_link" file, it will open the original file "file.txt".

### 2. Hard Links

Hard links: A hard link is a reference to a file or directory that is stored as an additional directory entry. Unlike a soft link, a hard link does not create a new file. It creates another entry point to the original file or directory. Both the original file and the hard link point to the same physical data on the disk.

### Example of creating a hard link:

Suppose you have a file called "file.txt" located in the "/home/user/documents/" directory, and you want to create a hard link for it in the "/home/user/desktop/" directory. You can use the following command:

```bash
ln /home/user/documents/file.txt /home/user/desktop/file_link
```

This creates a hard link called "file_link" in the "/home/user/desktop/" directory, which points to the original file "file.txt" located in the "/home/user/documents/" directory. If you modify either the original file or the hard link, the changes will be reflected in both the files, as they both point to the same physical data on the disk.

> Note: You cannot create a hard link for a directory.

***In summary, a soft link creates a new file that points to the original file or directory, while a hard link creates another entry point to the original file or directory. Both soft and hard links allow you to access a file or directory using a different name or path, but they differ in how they are stored and how they behave when the original file is modified or deleted.***

## Managing File Permissions

In Linux, there are three main types of permissions that can be set for files and directories:

1. **Read (r)**: Allows a user to view the contents of a file or directory.

2. **Write (w)**: Allows a user to modify the contents of a file or directory, including creating or deleting files within a directory.

3. **Execute (x)**: Allows a user to execute a file or access the contents of a directory.

<br>

These permissions can be assigned to three different categories of users:
<br>

1. **Owner (u)**: The user who owns the file or directory.

2. **Group (g)**: A group of users who have been given access to the file or directory.

3. **Other (o)**: All other users who are not the owner or part of the group.

<br>
Each file or directory has nine bits that determine the permissions for each of these three categories of users. These bits are represented by three sets of characters, where the first set represents the owner, the second set represents the group, and the third set represents other users.

<br>

|Owner|Group|Other|
|---|---|---|
|rwxr-|rx-|x|

<br>

Each set of characters consists of three characters, which can be either "r" for read, "w" for write, or "x" for execute. An example of file permissions would be "rwxr-xr-x", which represents read, write, and execute permissions for the owner, read and execute permissions for the group, and read and execute permissions for other users.

## Changing File Permissions with chmod

`chmod` (short for "change mode") is a command-line utility in Linux that allows you to change the permissions of a file or directory.

The `chmod` command uses a numeric or symbolic mode to specify the new permissions. The numeric mode assigns a value to each of the three categories of users (owner, group, and others) using a binary representation of the read, write, and execute permissions, where:

- Read permission is represented by the binary digit 4
- Write permission is represented by the binary digit 2
- Execute permission is represented by the binary digit 1

For example, the binary representation 111 (or 7 in decimal) represents read, write, and execute permissions. The binary representation 101 (or 5 in decimal) represents read and execute permissions, but not write permission.

<br>

| Binary Digit | Permission | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | --- | No permissions (equivalent to `--------`) |
| 1 | --x | Execute permission only |
| 2 | -w- | Write permission only |
| 3 | -wx | Write and execute permissions |
| 4 | r-- | Read permission only |
| 5 | r-x | Read and execute permissions |
| 6 | rw- | Read and write permissions |
| 7 | rwx | Read, write, and execute permissions |

<br>

In the table, the "Permission" column shows the corresponding permissions in symbolic notation, where "-" indicates that a permission is not granted and "r," "w," and "x" represent read, write, and execute permissions, respectively.
<br>

### To change file permissions using `chmod`, you would specify the new permissions as a numeric mode or a symbolic mode. Here are a few examples:

<br>

- To grant read, write, and execute permissions to the owner, but only read and execute permissions to group and others, you could use the numeric mode 750:
    ``` bash
    chmod 750 filename.txt
    ```
- To add write permission for the group, you could use the symbolic mode g+w:
    ``` bash
    chmod g+w filename.txt

    ```
- To remove execute permission for others, you could use the symbolic mode o-x:
    ``` bash
    chmod o-x filename.txt
    ```

> Note that you must have appropriate permissions to change the permissions of a file or directory. Only the owner of a file or directory, or a user with appropriate privileges, can change its permissions.
